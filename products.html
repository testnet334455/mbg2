                                coverage and then it expires. A Term plan has no cash value and only pays out if the individual passes away during the coverage period (versus a permanent or Whole Life policy). Some Term plans offer an option to convert
                                your plan to a Whole Life policy before it ends. Many individuals use Term policies as a tool to protect their assets such as a mortgage on a house, outstanding debts or anticipated college expenses for younger children.

                            <div class="prodtext">With an aging population, families are preparing for eventual long term care health expenses. Individuals can purchase a Long-Term Care (LTC) policy or get a Life Insurance policy with a Long-Term Care rider. Index Universal
                                Life (IULs) plans typically offer LTC riders. A licensed physician must attest that an individual has a cognitive impairment (e.g Alzheimer’s Dementia) or unable to perform two of the six Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).
                                The six ADLs are eating, bathing, toileting, dressing, transferring and continence. A Long-Term Care plan gives you the flexibility to help pay for care such as home healthcare, assisted living and skilled nursing, etc.
                                Having a long-term care insurance plan is a great strategy to protect your assets (home, savings, retirement accounts) and take the financial burden off your family for future medical expenses.
